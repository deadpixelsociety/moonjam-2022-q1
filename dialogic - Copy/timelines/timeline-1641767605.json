			"text": "I trudged up the stairs and into Thoroughbred's office. It looked a lot different in the light of day, without his grinning face, cheap insults, and dead body stinking up the joint.\nNow that I knew what I was looking for, I could see it all. And unlike the cops, I had the picture from last night to help me search.\nBloodstains spattering from the swings and the impact, mixed with gravy that flew from the tray when I swung. Signs of the brief struggle when Thoroughbred panicked and stood, trying run from me. Same way he ran from the law.\nSame way I was running.\nThe old gut twisted again, and I wanted to spill it all over this office, from the shame and the rage. But I didn't have time. I had to find where I stashed that tray, and make sure I didn't miss anything else incriminating while I was it.\n\nI couldn't remember, not consciously. But part of me would know.\n"
