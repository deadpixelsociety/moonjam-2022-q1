Some of those reinforced Bolivian Special Forces utensils scattered around, bits of crumbs and gravy, papers with blood and foodstuff on them. The laptop where he recorded all his greatest hits, somehow managed to stay on the desk during the fight.\nI checked for any piece of evidence that could pin me here, an incontrovertible sign that it was me. But if I could see it at first glance, then damn sure the cops had. I just had to pray there had been nothing to begin with, and look for something less obvious somewhere else."
