That's when I saw something I recognized, lying among the paperwork.\nA gift card to the Las Borpas Liquor Store that my wife got me for my birthday last week. God, she was so thoughtful, and actually real. I didn't deserve her.\nIt had been in my coat pocket, but when I got to the liquor store the night before, it wasn't there, and I just paid in cash. But if somebody started asking around... well, it could put them on my trail.\nAnd that would be a goddamn stupid way to get caught.\n"
