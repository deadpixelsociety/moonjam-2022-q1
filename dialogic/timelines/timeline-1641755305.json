Or at least my escape.\nPool chlorine, city smog, and mist, all mingle together in a cloying cocktail, stunting the senses.\nNow that I can see everything, not just dark blurs and devil shadows as I raced past in the murderous dark, I see how lucky I was. It's a miracle I didn't crash into the groundskeeper's tent.\nI need to know what he saw, or heard. And I need to get to my own evidence before the noble uniformed men and women of the Las Borpas PD do.\n"
