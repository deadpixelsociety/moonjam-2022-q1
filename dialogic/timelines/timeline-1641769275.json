Damn thing was practically drilled into the wall to keep it from falling off, it was so heavy.\nWait a second... how did I know that?\nI went over, and familiarity sunk in. My mind racing, not wanting to bring the weapon with me in case I was searched. Eyes swiveling wildly in my head, searching for a place to hide it, and seeing that heavy framed button, knowing nobody would think to check behind it.\nI stepped slowly towards it, checked over my shoulder to make sure nobody could see, and my fingers knew what to do. Pulled the bottom of the frame away from the wall, and felt something slip and fall against them. Bingo."
