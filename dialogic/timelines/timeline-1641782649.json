You might think it would be hard to be afraid of a man after watching him drink a glass boot full of Extra Spicy Coconut Mango Chutney, but you'd be wrong.\nBesides, underneath the jiggle and smooth talking was a ferocious and savvy businessman. Man knew how to pay the bills with money to spare.\nCan't trust somebody that sharp. He'd drink this town dry, one bottle at a time."
