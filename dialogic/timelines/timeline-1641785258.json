			"text": "I'd been a goddamned fool to think I could get away with it.\nTurns out, Las Borpas PD was staking out the Thoroughbred estate themselves. Heard he was up to some new scheme. I wasn't the only one who wanted to see him behind bars, after all.\nThey knew I'd been there. Saw me go in through the front door. Never saw me leave.\nWithout gunshots, or the sound of a struggle, stakeout didn't have a reason to make an arrest. But once the call came in saying Thoroughbred had been found dead in his office, I was suspect number one.\nThe only reason I got a phone call inviting me to the scene? Olivia. She wanted to give me a chance. See what I'd do. One last favor from a friend. One last out.\nThey'd been watching me the moment I stepped on the crime scene. When I lied about Henry's account. When I ruined a trail of mine that they'd already found. Then I headed straight to the evidence and pocketed it all.\nI fell for it, and fell hard. I admitted everything, told them all I could remember. Didn't even bother with a lawyer because I didn't want to have to write a court scene.\nAnd that's when Olivia told me the last bad news. The last bullet of fate leaving the chamber and putting me down for good.\nThe man I killed? When I threw it all away for the sake of one shot at fixing this goddamn city with my own two hands?\nCoroner's report came in.\nIt wasn't him.\nIt wasn't Thoroughbred.\nYung Dab was still alive."
