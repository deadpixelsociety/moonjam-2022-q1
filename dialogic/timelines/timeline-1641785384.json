He'd probably been hired by Dab to throw the cops off his scent while he went after his next sick scheme. All he to do was put on some face paint and spit shitty rap, and he had us all fooled.\nI was in here, and Thoroughbred was still out there, somewhere.\nDays passed. My wife, WIFENAME2, came to see me. Begged me to tell her that it wasn't true. That the drunk and disheveled detective she married and came home late at night reeking of booze and dirt couldn't be a killer.\nSorry honey. Guess you weren't the best judge of character.\nOne week after rotting in that cell, and that's when it happened.\nThat's when I got a call."
